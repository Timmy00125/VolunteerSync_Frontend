  - _Mitigation_: Create mock GraphQL schema and use Apollo MockLink for frontend development
- **GraphQL Complexity**: Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with GraphQL
  - _Mitigation_: Provide GraphQL training and use GraphQL Code Generator for type safety

#### 7.1.2 Medium Risk

- **Apollo Client Cache Complexity**: Cache management for complex data relationships
  - _Mitigation_: Use simple cache policies initially, implement advanced caching iteratively
- **GraphQL Query Optimization**: Over-fetching or under-fetching data
  - _Mitigation_: Use GraphQL fragments and careful query design
- **Browser Compatibility**: Angular 20 may have compatibility issues
  - _Mitigation_: Test early on target browsers

#### 7.1.3 Low Risk

- **UI Consistency**: Angular Material provides consistent base
- **Security**: GraphQL with Apollo Client provides built-in security patterns
- **Type Safety**: GraphQL Code Generator ensures type safety across operations

### 7.2 Project Assumptions

- GraphQL API will be available for integration testing
- Apollo Client is compatible with Angular 20 standalone components
- GraphQL subscriptions work reliably for real-time features
- Basic email service is available for password reset
- Standard deployment environment supports Angular applications with GraphQL

#### 7.2.2 Business Assumptions

- MVP feature set is sufficient for initial user validation
- Users will accept basic UI without advanced features
- Organizers can manage events with minimal administrative tools
- GraphQL's real-time capabilities will enhance user experience
- Email-based password reset is adequate for MVP

### 7.3 Mitigation Strategies

#### 7.3.1 Development Risks
