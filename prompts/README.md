## üöÄ Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Angular CLI, Node.js, Angular Material, and TailwindCSS are already installed.

1. **Start with Phase 1:** Begin with routing foundation and work through each prompt sequentially
2. **Use Angular CLI:** Each prompt specifies when to use `ng generate` commands
3. **Follow Best Practices:** All prompts include Angular 20 standalone components, signals, and modern patterns
4. **Test As You Go:** Implement tests alongside features for better quality

## üìù Prompt Structure

Each prompt includes:

- **Context:** Background and current state
- **Tasks:** Specific implementation tasks
- **Requirements:** Technical and functional requirements
- **Implementation Instructions:** Step-by-step guidance
- **Technical Requirements:** Coding standards and patterns
- **Files to Create/Modify:** Specific file operations
- **Success Criteria:** How to validate completion

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Angular 20 with standalone components
- **State Management:** Signals and RxJS
- **Data Layer:** Apollo Client with GraphQL
- **UI Library:** Angular Material
- **Styling:** Custom theme with TailwindCSS utilities
- **Testing:** Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript 5+ with strict mode

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
