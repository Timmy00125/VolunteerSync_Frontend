## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

### 9.1 Example User Flows

#### 9.1.1 Event Registration Flow

1. User views event list
2. User clicks on event of interest
3. User views event details and clicks "Register"
4. System checks capacity and user authentication
5. If space available and user authenticated, registration succeeds
6. User sees confirmation and event appears in their dashboard

#### 9.1.2 Event Creation Flow

1. Organizer logs in and navigates to "Create Event"
2. Organizer fills out event form (all required fields)
3. System validates input and saves event
4. Event appears in public listing and organizer's dashboard

### 9.2 Edge Cases

#### 9.2.1 Capacity Management

- Event reaches maximum volunteers: Registration button disabled
- User tries to register for full event: Clear error message shown
- Last spot filled while user viewing: Graceful handling with refresh

#### 9.2.2 Data Validation
